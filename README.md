# Team-Float
This repository contains all relevant pieces of software that were created by Team Float for the course 1ZM250 Innovation through Art &amp; Design at the TU/e.

The files starting with 'Tree_lights' contain the Arduino files that control the lighting effects for the tree.
  - 'Tree_lights_constant_off' fully turns off all LEDs.
  - 'Tree_lights_constant_green' turns all LEDs fully on with a green color.
  - 'Tree_lights_startup' gradually turns on all LEDs from fully off to fully on with a green color.
